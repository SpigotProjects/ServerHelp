About
=====

I created the ServerHelp plugin for the sole purpose of helping people. ServerHelp is the first ever plugin I made for the Spigot/Bukkit community. Before I tell you about my plugin, I want you to know that this plugin can't be distributed to people (for money).

Why should I get this plugin? 
=============================
Good question! This plugin will eliminate tons of questions players ask you. Some of those many questions are:
- How do I play?
- Are you a staff member?
- Who are the staff members?
- How do I earn money?
- What is the support email?
- Who is the owner?
- What commands do I have access to?
and many more!

What are the commands and permissions?
======================================
Note: Operators (OPs) always have these permissions.. Please also note, that for this plugin you need to have a permission plugin. Some examples are: PermissionsEx, bPermissions, GroupManager and ect.
